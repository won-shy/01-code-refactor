# Horiseon Website Code Refactor

## Description

This was our first project in which we refactored existing code of the agency, Horiseon, so that it is better optimized for SEO and more accessible.

## Things Learned

* How to use better semantic elements for specificity
* Why it is important to add alt text for those that may not be able to see the webpages
* How to apply "DRY" principle to make code more efficient, both in index.html and CSS stylesheets

## Changes

HTML CHANGES

* Title changed to Horiseon
* Changed unnnecessary div to section for semantics
* Added main tag for organization
* Added alt text for each image in the main body
* Added alt text for side graphics
* Changed last div to footer for semantics

CSS Changes

* Grouped like elements
* Reordered to follow better structure (made sure to follow priority of elements top to bottom so that the correct values would be shown)
* Added comments between each section for easier reading

## Installation

* Used VSCode
* Local Repo git pushed to Github through "git push origin main"
